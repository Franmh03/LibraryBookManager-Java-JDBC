ðŸ“š LibraryBookManager-Java-JDBC

This project is a Library Book Management System built using Java and JDBC. It allows users to manage a collection of books, authors, and loans in a library. The application is entirely console-based and interacts with a MySQL database to perform CRUD operations.

ðŸ›  Features:

Register books and authors

Track user loans and returns

View available books in the library

Simple, low-level SQL database management through Java


ðŸ’¡ Purpose

Working on this project has greatly helped me in understanding SQL databases and how to handle low-level database management with Java and JDBC. The hands-on experience of building this system has deepened my knowledge of working with MySQL, and itâ€™s a key piece of my portfolio.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

Java

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

MySQL
